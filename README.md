## 👋 Hi there, I'm Zubair Moosa! 
### Thanks for checking out my profile 😁

I'm a full-stack web developer (i.e. serial googler) with a focus on Angular, Node and C# .NET developement. 
I currently live and work in Johannesburg, South Africa :south_africa: 
but my dream is to travel the world as a digital nomad. 🌍
